# transform

Thanks for stopping by!

**transform** is an R package that contains a variety of (hopefully) short and intuitive functions that handle common multi-line data transformations.

So why should you consider using **transform** for your data analysis work?  The functions within **transform** are designed to address some of the issues that I have experienced with writing adhoc transformation code for projects:

+ **Minimize the amount of coding** necessary for common data transformations.
+ **Enhance the readability of your code** (both for yourself and for others!) by using intuitive function calls.
+ **Boost your confidence that data transformations are occuring as expected** with reviewable documentation and unit testing.

If you're new to **transform**, I would suggest <a href="https://github.com/derek-damron/transform/wiki">moseying on over to the Wiki</a> for information about <a href="https://github.com/derek-damron/transform/wiki/installation">installation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/derek-damron/transform/wiki/philosophy">the philosophy of the package</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/derek-damron/transform/wiki/functions">a brief introduction to the functions in the package</a> before you start getting your hands dirty.

For more technical information about specific functions within **transform**, please review the function documentation that automatically builds when you install the package (e.g. `?trim` or `help(rescale)`)
