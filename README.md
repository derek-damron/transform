## What is *transformr*?

*transformr*, as you might have guessed, is an R package that helps you easily transform your variables.

So why should you consider using *transformr* for your data analysis work?

1. **Robustness**: All of the functions within *transformr* have been loaded with argument checks, unit tests, and informative error messages so good luck trying to break them!  (But, by all means, do try to break them and then [create an issue so we can fix what's broken](https://github.com/derek-damron/transformr/issues/new)!)
2. **Convenience**: Could you write functions to do these transformations? Absolutely, but why bother when it's already been done for you?

## Installing *transformr*

You can install *transformr* using the following code:

```R
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("derek-damron/transformr")
```

## Introductory Vignette

Check out the [introductory vignette](https://derek-damron.github.io/transformr/) for a quick introduction to the functions contained within *transformr*!
