## What is *transform*?

*transform*, as you might have guessed, is an R package that helps you easily transform your variables.

So why should you consider using *transform* for your data analysis work?

1. **Robustness**: All of the functions within *transform* have been loaded with argument checks, unit tests, and informative error messages so good luck trying to break them!  (But, by all means, do try to break them and then [create an issue so we can fix what's broken](https://github.com/derek-damron/transform/issues/new)!)
2. **Convenience**: Could you write functions to do these transformations? Absolutely, but why bother when it's already been done for you?

## Installing *transform*

You can install *transform* using the following code:

```
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
install_github("derek-damron/transform")
```

## Introductory Vignette

Check out the [introductory vignette](https://derek-damron.github.io/transform/) for a quick introduction to the functions contained within * transform*!
