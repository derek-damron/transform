# transform

Thanks for stopping by!

`transform` is an R package that contains a variety of (hopefully) short and intuitive functions that handle common data transformations.

So why should you consider using `transform` for your data analysis work?  The functions within `transform` are designed to address some of the issues that I have experienced with writing adhoc transformation code for projects:

+ **Minimize the amount of coding** necessary for common data transformations.
+ **Enhance the readability of your code** (both for yourself and for others!) by using intuitive function calls.
+ **Boost your confidence that data transformations are occuring as expected** with reviewable unit testing.
